# Architecture Best Practices
- **TDD (Test-Driven Development)** - write the tests first; the implementation
  code isn't done until the tests pass.
- **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)** – eliminate duplicated logic by extracting
  shared utilities and modules.
- **Separation of Concerns** – each module should handle one distinct
  responsibility.
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** – every class/module/function/file
  should have exactly one reason to change.
- **Clear Abstractions & Contracts** – expose intent through small, stable
  interfaces and hide implementation details.
- **Low Coupling, High Cohesion** – keep modules self-contained, minimize
  cross-dependencies.
- **Scalability & Statelessness** – design components to scale horizontally and
  prefer stateless services when possible.
- **Observability & Testability** – build in logging, metrics, tracing, and
  ensure components can be unit/integration tested.
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Sir)** - keep solutions as simple as possible.
- **YAGNI (You're Not Gonna Need It)** – avoid speculative complexity or
  over-engineering.
- **Don't Swallow Errors** by catching expections, silently filling in required
  but missing values or adding timeouts when something hangs unexpectedly. All
  of those are exceptions that should be thrown so that the errors can be seen,
  root causes can be found and fixes can be applied.
- **No Placeholder Code** - we're building production code here, not toys.
- **No Comments for Removed Functionality** - the source is not the place to
  keep history of what's changed; it's the place to implement the current
  requirements only.
- **Layered Architecture** - organize code into clear tiers where each layer
  depends only on the one(s) below it, keeping logic cleanly separated.
- **Prefer Non-Nullable Variables** when possible; use nullability sparingly.
- **Prefer Async Notifications** when possible over inefficient polling.
- **Consider First Principles** to assess your current architecture against the
  one you'd use if you started over from scratch.
- **Eliminate Race Condtions** that might cause dropped or corrupted data
