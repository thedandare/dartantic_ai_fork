---

The dartantic_chat package provides the widgets to make it easy to add an AI
chat window to your Flutter app. The package is organized around an abstract
chat history provider API that makes it easy to swap out the agentic SDK or REST
endpoint that you'd like your chat widget to use. Out of the box, it comes with
support for [dartantic_ai](https://pub.dev/packages/dartantic_ai), which
provides access to multiple LLM providers including Google Gemini, OpenAI,
Anthropic, Mistral, and Ollama.
